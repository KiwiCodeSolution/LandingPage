              This is the starting point and the most important part because it helps to visualize the whole future
              website and all its features. Everything can be thought over to the smallest detail of how everything will
              be working, the website logic, and the final structure. Hence, this is the best way to understand what do
              you want to get, and you will be able to control every corner of the development, which means not a single
              little thing will go unnoticed.
